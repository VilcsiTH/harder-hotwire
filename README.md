## Special thanks!
A huge thank you from the bottom of my heart to all these individuals! Without them, this mod couldn't have been made.

rez for their work on Harder Hotwire, the idea behind it, the UI art used in this mod and the base code from where I began work.
iBrRus for their work on Autotsar Trailers and Aiteron for their work on Better Lockpicking. Thanks to these very talented individuals, I was able to figure out how to rewrite the mod to not override the whole radial menu but to add onto it.

Please give them lots and lots of love!
At the end of the day, I'm very much a beginner. I'm learning computer science at my local university, but this was the first time I've modded Project Zomboid and it was a huge learning experience, and I would've been lost if not for these people.
If any of you are reading this; I promise to make it up to you one of these days.
